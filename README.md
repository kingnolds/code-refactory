# <Code-Refactor-Horiseon>
## Description
This is a refactor of the Horiseon website in order to make it more accessible and efficient, but to keep the appearance and functionality the same.

Changes made include updating to semantic html tags, cleaning up redundancies in the css, and adding a descriptive page title.
Class attributes where consolidated for items with identical styling
The main "hero" image was givin a title for accessibility and other images were given null alt text because they are not informative.
h3 tags in the aside were changed to h2 tags to conform with heading hierarchy best practices and the font size was updated to keep the same look
An id tag was added so that the all of the nav bar links worked correctly
Some css elements where moved to better reflect the html organization
Comments added in css for future readability

Working on this project has taught me better understanding of semantic elements, css streamlining and organization, accessibility, and readme practices.
